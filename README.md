# vibe-check

Suppose I took every sentence you've ever said and computed the sentiment from -1 to 1. 

-1 being the most negative, 0 as neutral, and 1 as the most positive.

If you average the score from everything you said, are you a positive or negative person?

What if it turned out that your score was very negative? Would this change how you interact with others?

This is a literal vibe check.
